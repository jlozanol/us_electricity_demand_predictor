# US Electricity Demand Forecasting System

## Project Overview

This project implements a modular, end-to-end electricity demand forecasting system for the United States. Designed with scalability, automation, and real-time capabilities in mind, it supports reliable demand predictions by integrating data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, inference, and visualization pipelines. Built using modern MLOps practices, the system ensures high-quality predictions, simplified deployments, and continuous improvement.

## Business Problem

Power utilities in the U.S. face significant operational challenges due to unpredictable fluctuations in electricity demand:

- ‚ö° **Overproduction** leads to energy waste and higher generation costs.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Shortages** can result in brownouts or blackouts, reducing service reliability.  
- üåç **Inefficient resource allocation** increases carbon emissions and harms sustainability goals.

The ability to **predict hourly electricity demand across multiple U.S. regions** is essential for operational efficiency, grid stability, and cost control.

---

## ML Problem

Build an accurate, scalable ML system to predict **next-hour electricity demand** across U.S. regions based on recent demand and weather data. The model should learn regional consumption patterns and respond to external conditions such as holidays and temperature changes.

---

## Data Sources

The system integrates publicly available data sources for demand and weather analytics:

- üèõ **Electricity Demand**: Hourly historical demand from the [U.S. EIA API](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/)  
- üå¶ **Weather Data**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation from the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)

Both datasets are processed in batch and real-time modes and stored in a **Hopsworks Feature Store** for model training and inference.

## Architecture & Pipeline Philosophy

This project adopts a **three-pipeline architecture**, promoting modularity, maintainability, and real-time readiness:

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Ingestion Pipeline  
- **Goal**: Collect raw demand and weather data from external APIs.
- **Microservices**: `ingest_demand`, `ingest_weather`
- **Transport Layer**: Kafka (via Quix Streams)

### üîç 2. Feature Engineering & Storage Pipeline  
- **Goal**: Enrich raw data with time-based and statistical features, and persist in a ML feature store.
- **Microservices**: `feature_demand`, `to_featurestore_demand`, `to_featurestore_weather`
- **Store**: Hopsworks Feature Store (supports historical and live pipelines)

### üß† 3. Modeling & Inference Pipeline  
- **Goal**: Train region-specific ML models and generate demand forecasts in real-time.
- **Microservices**: `demand_predictor`, `inference_client` (Streamlit dashboard)
- **Model Registry**: Comet ML
